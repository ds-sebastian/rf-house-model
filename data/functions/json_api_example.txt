I am a teacher at Holly Grove and a parent. I love going to work every day, the students are great and my colleagues are awesome. I work with some pretty incredible people. As a parent, I know the teachers are high caliber and are going to challenge my daughter. I love how involved the community is at the school. We have so many resources. Holly Grove is fortunate enough to have intervention teachers for students that struggle and enrichment teachers across grade levels for students that need to be challenged. The school has an awesome specialist team, students are able to enjoy PE, Spanish, Music, Technology, Art, and Science specials. The special ed resource team is the best around. I feel I need to say this because it was referenced in another review: I enjoy my job and the administrators (principal and assistant principals) treat me with respect. They have an open door policy and I have never felt that I could not speak my mind. I am encouraged to grow professionally and to utilize my strengths, something I look for in a school. I would recommend HGES to anyone.","reviewerRating":5,"lastUpdatedDate":"Jun 30, 2021","institutionGreatschoolId":3703428,"maponicsId":2443278,"url":"https://www.greatschools.org/north-carolina/holly-springs/3428-Holly-Grove-Elementary/"},{"schoolId":25877671,"reviewedBy":"other","datePosted":"Jan 25, 2017","review":"I wonder what caused the negative review from the previous reviewer.

The principal is horrible. She\u0027s unfriendly, unapproachable, has bad communication skills and is generally disliked by kids, parents and teachers alike. We are losing amazing teachers and staff because they are taking jobs at other schools to get away from her. They are also losing wonderful kids and parent volunteers as they are leaving the school and looking for better options.

Since leaving and putting my children in a different school... their attitudes changed. They love school now and are doing well. Some of the teachers at HGE are very grumpy and way to harsh/yelling at the children for the smallest things. ( I saw this first had, as a volunteer) The children act out in class because they are so stifled during the day. If your children are happy at school they will succeed.

It has been at HRE for 1.5 years - teachers work with it the best they can. I am aware that due to the curriculum/testing changes, there was an across the board lowering of scores in NC this last year (the 1st with the new curriculum) - which is not uncommon when a complete curriculum/testing change takes place. As far as parent involvement, I have been very involved as a classroom volunteer, general school volunteer and PTA volunteer and have always felt very needed and welcome in these various roles.

The teachers have been great and have done a great job at preparing him for high school. The school is very safe, they keep a police officer on site. Despite other comments about drugs, I have not seen or heard of anything like this. They have police dogs come in every now and then to sniff around and all searches have come up clean. I\u0027ve never heard of fights in the hallways or anything like that. My son has truly enjoyed his time here and I feel he will be ready for high school. The only problem I did have was the electives. They need to offer better electives for boys especially. Having dance and chorus as an elective and trying to force a boy into either of these is not really a fair thing to do. They tried to tell me that was all they had to offer, but after fighting for 2-3 weeks to get him moved out of chorus they were able to make an adjustment and put him in Spanish. Chorus might be fine for some boys, but mine is not into music at all and especially doesn\u0027t want to have to get in front of people and sing. When I was in middles school we had woodshop, metal shop, and graphic arts. So, I do think they could offer better electives. In my opinion, dance is an after school activity-not an elective.","reviewerRating":4,"lastUpdatedDate":"Jun 30, 2021","institutionGreatschoolId":3707879,"maponicsId":1643530,"url":"https://www.greatschools.org/north-carolina/holly-springs/7879-Holly-Grove-Middle-School/"},{"schoolId":8438139,"reviewedBy":"parent","datePosted":"Apr 26, 2015","review":"Holly Grove started out as a great school for my son.

There are NO other viable alternatives to the public school system in the Holly Springs/Fuquay area, which public schools have sadly become so overcrowded and unsuitable environments for quality education. I withdrew my child from HRMS and enrolled her in SWA. She quickly became confident and is now eager to participate in her education. The smaller class setting allows SWA teachers to actually supervise and help students in need. The uniform/dress code provides opportunity for kids to focus on education, not clothing or status quo. The school has a zero tolerance towards bullying, which has plagued public schools. The bar is set higher for quality learning, good conduct, leadership, and respect. I am truly impressed.

It also surprises me that someone who teaches in a middle school where students are taught to be an individual and not follow the crowd, would be so judgemental. As long as my child is doing well in school, not into drugs or alcohol or even cussing and her behavior is good, I count her haircolor and choices of clothing a minor issue.

Holly Grove is fortunate enough to have intervention teachers for students that struggle and enrichment teachers across grade levels for students that need to be challenged. The school has an awesome specialist team, students are able to enjoy PE, Spanish, Music, Technology, Art, and Science specials. The special ed resource team is the best around. I feel I need to say this because it was referenced in another review: I enjoy my job and the administrators (principal and assistant principals) treat me with respect.

I\u0027ve never heard of fights in the hallways or anything like that. My son has truly enjoyed his time here and I feel he will be ready for high school. The only problem I did have was the electives. They need to offer better electives for boys especially. Having dance and chorus as an elective and trying to force a boy into either of these is not really a fair thing to do. They tried to tell me that was all they had to offer, but after fighting for 2-3 weeks to get him moved out of chorus they were able to make an adjustment and put him in Spanish. Chorus might be fine for some boys, but mine is not into music at all and especially doesn\u0027t want to have to get in front of people and sing. When I was in middles school we had woodshop, metal shop, and graphic arts. So, I do think they could offer better electives.

The school has an awesome specialist team, students are able to enjoy PE, Spanish, Music, Technology, Art, and Science specials. The special ed resource team is the best around. I feel I need to say this because it was referenced in another review: I enjoy my job and the administrators (principal and assistant principals) treat me with respect.

My son is definitely excelling at this school.","reviewerRating":5,"lastUpdatedDate":"Jun 30, 2021","institutionGreatschoolId":3707879,"maponicsId":2434998,"url":"https://www.greatschools.org/north-carolina/holly-springs/7879-Holly-Grove-Middle-School/"},{"schoolId":25878200,"reviewedBy":"other","datePosted":"Oct 27, 2016","review":"My son is a 6th grader and so far so good.

The teachers have been great and have done a great job at preparing him for high school. The school is very safe, they keep a police officer on site. Despite other comments about drugs, I have not seen or heard of anything like this. They have police dogs come in every now and then to sniff around and all searches have come up clean. I\u0027ve never heard of fights in the hallways or anything like that. My son has truly enjoyed his time here and I feel he will be ready for high school. The only problem I did have was the electives. They need to offer better electives for boys especially. Having dance and chorus as an elective and trying to force a boy into either of these is not really a fair thing to do. They tried to tell me that was all they had to offer, but after fighting for 2-3 weeks to get him moved out of chorus they were able to make an adjustment and put him in Spanish. Chorus might be fine for some boys, but mine is not into music at all and especially doesn\u0027t want to have to get in front of people and sing. When I was in middles school we had woodshop, metal shop, and graphic arts. So, I do think they could offer better electives. In my opinion, dance is an after school activity-not an elective.","reviewerRating":4,"lastUpdatedDate":"Jun 30, 2021","institutionGreatschoolId":3707879,"maponicsId":1643530,"url":"https://www.greatschools.org/north-carolina/holly-springs/7879-Holly-Grove-Middle-School/"},{"schoolId":8438139,"reviewedBy":"parent","datePosted":"Apr 26, 2015","review":"Holly Grove started out as a great school for my son. The teachers were helpful, welcoming, and cheerful with a great attitude. Then everything changed when a teacher that came over from Fuquay-Varina Middle started working there. The teachers went from cheerful and helpful to being verbally abusive and mentally draining for my son. To give a great example, the schools motto is, \"Every child will succeed\" well, a teacher told my son, \"Well, that doesn\u0027t mean that every child will succeed at success, some kids may succeed at failure...\" Now, if you have become so frustrated with your job that you feel the need to say this to a student, maybe it is time for a new profession.","reviewerRating":2,"lastUpdatedDate":"Jun 30, 2021","institutionGreatschoolId":3707879,"maponicsId":1588260,"url":"https://www.greatschools.org/north-carolina/holly-springs/7879-Holly-Grove-Middle-School/"},{"schoolId":8438138,"reviewedBy":"parent","datePosted":"Feb 20, 2014","review":"Holly Grove Middle is one of the most welcoming schools I have ever been in.
